<p> My names are Sulaimon Fasilat Adunola ,
	        I am sweet,caring, and a loving 
		 lady.</p>
<p>I have learned from the very start,
		the importance of passion,
		 dedication,confidence and time management.
		My family is made upme and four sisters
		 amongst my parents and my grandparents.
		My family is what my parents had worked for,which is a completely
		happy and satisfied one.</p>
<p>I am students of kwara state university of malete currently studying computer Science
		at 200 level</p>
<p>Therefore, writing about myself,
		i am here to express myself what
		 i plan for my life is the total manifestation of what i doand learn today.
		I try myself to be humble,passionate,
		 dedicated,hardworking and honest.</p>
<p>I deem my parents as being my best mentors.
		I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from not only my parents but everyone i come across in life.
		i am with a happy,focused and hardworking family.
		That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me.</p>
